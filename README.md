# Side channel attacks
* Hweight_dpa_sca_aes_sbox.py : A schoolbook example of correlation power analysis side channel analysis of Advanced Encryption Standard's S-box based hacking.
* Hdist_dpa_sca_aes_sbox.py : Roughly the same, but with Hamming distances being considered as the primary leakage source.
* AES_cpa_sca_16x.py : A more near life solution where multiple S-box computations comprise the leakage. As such, the example also shows, that this attack works in the presence of noise, because when the input of a particular S-box is being guessed, all other S-box substitutions are meaningless (algorithmic) noise in the leakage data.
* distribution_based_hacking.py proves that a byte-wise computation of the AES can be hacked without aa choosen or at least eavesdropped cipher text. Simply by knowing that the input data stream is white noise and comparing its computation's measured Hamming weight distribution against expected power consumption data, the key bytes can already be safely determined. This comparison is based on calculating the squared error between the distributions instead of correlating them.
* AES_mia_sca.py: A side channel attack based on the core concept of mutual information analysis, that measures the likelyhoods of certain output values with respect to choosen inputs, and then kind of correlates the two histogram like distributions, to find the best matching for a certain key. Also implemented for arbitrary amount of S-boxes, enabling the user to test in algorithmic noise. The implementation requires roughly as many samples as CPA to guess most of the keys, yet it is way way faster to calculate!
