# Side_channel_attacks
* Hweight_dpa_sca_aes_sbox.py : A schoolbook example of differential power analysis side channel analysis of Advanced Encryption Standard's S-box based hacking.
* Hdist_dpa_sca_aes_sbox.py : Roughly the same, but with Hamming distances being considered as the primary leakage source.
* Hweight_dpa_sca_16x_aes_sbox.py : A more near life solution where multiple S-box computations comprise the leakage. As such, the example also shows, that this attack works in the presence of noise, because when the input of a particular S-box is being guessed, all other S-box substitutions are meaningless (algorithmic) noise in the leakage data.
* distribution_based_hacking.py : a code snippet showing that in case of 1 single AES-Sbox, the distribution of the choosen plain texts can be enough for recovering the corresponding key byte! Just by comparing the hypothetical distributions of power switches for every possible key to the actual one generated during a running encryption. Meaning one doesn't need access to influence the processed data, doesn't even need the option to observe it, it may be enough to know if it is for example English text with its specific probabilistic character distribution. This demo was made using an even distribution.
